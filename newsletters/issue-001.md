# Solo Founder Tools Weekly — Issue #1

**Subject line:** The AI coding tool that's replacing entire dev teams

---

Hey,

Welcome to the first issue of Solo Founder Tools Weekly. One tool deep-dive, a few quick picks, and one tip — every week.

## Tool of the Week: Cursor

If you're writing code as a solo founder, Cursor is the tool that's changed the game more than anything in the past year.

It's a VS Code fork with AI built into every interaction. Not just autocomplete — you can select code, hit Cmd+K, and tell it what to change in plain English. Need to refactor a component? Add error handling? Convert a class to TypeScript? Just describe it.

**What's good:**
- Your existing VS Code extensions work
- The inline editing (Cmd+K) is genuinely faster than writing code manually
- Tab completion predicts multi-line edits, not just single lines
- Chat understands your full codebase via @-mentions

**What's not:**
- $20/mo adds up when you're bootstrapping
- Can hallucinate on complex multi-file refactors
- You'll still need to review everything it writes

**Verdict:** If you write code daily, the $20/mo pays for itself in the first hour. If you code occasionally, GitHub Copilot at $10/mo is good enough.

## Quick Picks

**Resend** — Email API that doesn't make you want to scream. Clean docs, generous free tier (3,000 emails/mo), built by the team behind react.email. [See details →](https://founderstoolkit.org/tools/resend)

**Plausible** — Privacy-friendly analytics that actually tells you what you need to know without the 47 Google Analytics dashboards. Starts at $9/mo. [See details →](https://founderstoolkit.org/tools/plausible)

**Supabase** — Postgres database + auth + storage in one. The free tier is absurdly generous for solo projects. [See details →](https://founderstoolkit.org/tools/supabase)

## Tip of the Week

**Don't subscribe to more than 3 paid tools at launch.** Every tool feels essential when you're reading the landing page. But most solo founders need: hosting (free tier), payments (percentage-based), and one productivity tool. Everything else can wait until you have paying customers. Use our [Stack Builder](https://founderstoolkit.org/stack-builder) to see what a realistic stack costs.

That's it for this week. If you found this useful, forward it to a founder friend.
