# Brainstorm: Solo Founder Tools Directory

## Goal
A curated directory of software tools for solopreneurs, indie hackers, and one-person businesses. Agent-operated after initial setup. Revenue from featured listings.

## Project Type
Autonomous micro-business — shippable product designed to run with minimal human involvement.

## Key Constraints & Principles
- Non-Claude costs must stay within €0-50/month
- After initial setup, agents handle all operations
- No regulated domains (health, finance, legal advice)
- Boring and stable over exciting and trendy
- Human involvement only for truly unavoidable strategic decisions
- Weekend setup timeline
