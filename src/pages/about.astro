          A curated directory of software tools for solopreneurs, indie hackers, and one-person businesses.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Directory?</h2>
        <p>
          When you're building a business solo, every tool choice matters. You don't have a team to evaluate options, and you can't afford to waste time on tools that don't work for your scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          This directory exists to help solo founders find the right tools faster. Every listing includes honest pros and cons, real pricing information, and relevant alternatives.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Curate</h2>
        <p>
          We focus on tools that work well for solo founders and small teams:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reasonable pricing for individuals and small businesses</li>
          <li>Good developer/user experience</li>
          <li>Proven reliability and active development</li>
          <li>Clear documentation and support options</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Featured Listings</h2>
        <p>
          Tools marked as "Featured" have paid for prominent placement. This helps us keep the directory running. Featured status doesn't affect our honest assessment of pros and cons — we include those for every tool, featured or not.
        </p>
