          As a solo founder, you cannot afford to spend weeks setting up authentication, databases, file storage, and server functions from scratch. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms bundle all of this into a single product so you can focus on building your actual application. Here are the five platforms worth considering in 2026.

        <h2>Supabase: the open-source Firebase alternative</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/supabase">Supabase</a> gives you a real Postgres database with auth, file storage, edge functions, and real-time subscriptions included. The free tier provides 500MB of database storage and 1GB of file storage, which is enough to build and launch an MVP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main advantage is data portability. Because it runs on standard Postgres, your data and queries are not locked into a proprietary system. If you ever need to move away from Supabase, you can export your database and host it anywhere Postgres runs. For a solo founder building something long-term, this matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pro tier at $25/mo gives you 8GB database storage, 100GB file storage, and removes the 7-day inactivity pause on the free tier. Edge functions are still maturing compared to Firebase Cloud Functions, but they cover most use cases. The learning curve assumes some SQL knowledge. If you have never written a SQL query, Supabase will feel harder than Firebase.
        </p>

        <h2>PocketBase: the zero-cost option</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/pocketbase">PocketBase</a> is a complete backend in a single executable file. Download it, run it, and you get a SQLite database, authentication, file storage, real-time subscriptions, and an admin dashboard. There is no cloud service and no monthly bill. It is completely free under the MIT license.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tradeoff is that you are responsible for hosting and operations. You need a VPS (roughly $5-10/mo from providers like DigitalOcean or Hetzner), and you handle backups, updates, and uptime yourself. PocketBase uses SQLite, which works well for low-to-moderate traffic but is not designed for high-concurrency workloads.
        </p>
        <p>
          For solo founders building an MVP or a side project that does not need to handle thousands of concurrent users, PocketBase is hard to beat on cost. It is also remarkably fast to set up. You can have a working backend in under ten minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>Appwrite: self-host or cloud, your choice</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/appwrite">Appwrite</a> is an open-source backend platform that provides auth, databases, file storage, cloud functions, and messaging. The self-hosted version has no limits on usage, and Appwrite Cloud starts at $25/mo per project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appwrite's strongest feature is multi-language support. It offers SDKs for over 10 languages and frameworks, which is useful if you are not building exclusively in JavaScript. The platform also includes built-in messaging (email, SMS, push) that Supabase and PocketBase lack out of the box.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community is smaller than Supabase's or Firebase's, which means fewer tutorials and Stack Overflow answers when you get stuck. The cloud free tier is more limited on resources than Supabase's. But if you want an all-in-one BaaS that you can self-host with no restrictions, Appwrite delivers.
        </p>

        <h2>Convex: real-time by default</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/convex">Convex</a> takes a different approach. Instead of giving you a database and separate API layer, Convex merges them into a single reactive system. Write your server functions in TypeScript, and clients automatically receive real-time updates when data changes. No WebSocket setup, no manual cache invalidation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The free Starter plan is pay-as-you-go with no base cost, which is practical for prototyping. The Professional plan at $25/mo per team member adds support and higher limits. Convex is TypeScript-first with end-to-end type safety, making it a strong fit for React and Next.js projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The downside is vendor lock-in. There is no self-hosting option, and Convex uses a proprietary database format. If you decide to switch later, migrating your data and rewriting your backend logic will take significant effort. The community is also newer and smaller, so finding help outside the official docs can be harder.
        </p>

        <h2>Firebase: the established player</h2>
        <p>
          Firebase is Google's BaaS platform and the most mature option on this list. Firestore (the NoSQL database), Firebase Auth, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions give you a complete backend. The free Spark plan is generous: 1GB Firestore storage, 5GB Cloud Storage, and 50K daily auth operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firebase excels at mobile development. The SDKs for iOS and Android are excellent, and features like crash reporting, analytics, and A/B testing are built in. Google's infrastructure means you rarely worry about scaling or reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problems are well-known: NoSQL data modeling can be awkward, Firestore's query limitations push you toward denormalization, and costs become unpredictable at scale because of the pay-per-read pricing model. There is no self-hosting, and migrating away from Firebase means rewriting significant parts of your backend. For new projects in 2026, Supabase has taken over as the default recommendation for most web applications.

        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/supabase">Supabase</a></strong> if you want the best balance of features, community, and data portability. It is the default BaaS for most solo-founded web applications in 2026, and the Postgres foundation means you are never locked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/pocketbase">PocketBase</a></strong> if you want to pay nothing and are comfortable managing your own server. Ideal for MVPs, prototypes, and projects where you want to keep costs at absolute zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/appwrite">Appwrite</a></strong> if you need multi-language SDK support or want a self-hostable platform with built-in messaging. It fills a niche between Supabase and PocketBase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/convex">Convex</a></strong> if you are building a real-time TypeScript application and want the developer experience of having your database and API as one reactive system. Accept the vendor lock-in tradeoff.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose Firebase</strong> if you are building a mobile app and want the deepest integration with iOS, Android, and the Google ecosystem.
