        <h2>By use case: which builder fits your project?</h2>

        <h3>Landing pages and marketing sites</h3>
        <p>
          If you need a clean marketing site or a landing page for your product, <a href="/tools/framer">Framer</a> is the strongest option in 2026. The AI site generation feature produces genuinely usable designs. Templates are modern and well-designed. The free tier lets you publish on a framer.site subdomain, and the Mini plan at $5/mo adds a custom domain. Performance is excellent because Framer generates static HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/carrd">Carrd</a> is the budget alternative if you only need a single page. At $19/year for the Pro plan, it is the cheapest option on this list. The simplicity is the point: you pick a layout, fill in your content, publish. No CMS, no blog, no multi-page navigation. Just one clean page. Built by a solo founder, for solo founders.
        </p>

        <h3>Portfolios and creative sites</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/squarespace">Squarespace</a> has been the go-to portfolio builder for years, and it still holds up. The templates are polished and visually striking out of the box. Everything is included: hosting, domain, SSL, e-commerce. Starting at $16/mo, it is not the cheapest, but you pay for a level of design quality that is hard to replicate elsewhere without hiring a designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/framer">Framer</a> is a strong alternative if you prefer a more modern aesthetic with interactions and animations. The design freedom is greater than Squarespace, though the CMS is more limited.
        </p>

        <h3>Complex websites with CMS and dynamic content</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/webflow">Webflow</a> is the most powerful no-code builder on this list. The visual editor gives you CSS-level control over layout and styling. The built-in CMS handles blogs, product catalogs, team directories, and any structured content. E-commerce is included on higher-tier plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tradeoff is a genuine learning curve. Webflow's interface exposes concepts like flexbox, grid, and class hierarchies that other builders hide. If you are comfortable with those concepts or willing to invest a few hours learning, the payoff is a professional-grade site that exports clean code. If you want drag-and-drop simplicity, look elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h3>E-commerce</h3>
        <p>
          For selling physical or digital products, <a href="/tools/squarespace">Squarespace</a> and <a href="/tools/wix">Wix</a> both provide built-in e-commerce. Squarespace's Commerce plan starts at $27/mo with inventory management, shipping labels, and abandoned cart recovery. Wix offers similar e-commerce features through its Business plan at $17/mo, with the addition of an app marketplace for extending store functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/webflow">Webflow</a> also supports e-commerce starting at $29/mo, with more design control but fewer built-in selling features than Squarespace. For a solo founder running a small store, Squarespace is the path of least resistance.
        </p>

        <h3>Blogs</h3>
        <p>
          If blogging is your primary need, a dedicated publishing platform like <a href="/tools/ghost">Ghost</a> or <a href="/tools/wordpress">WordPress</a> will serve you better than a website builder. But if you want a blog alongside your main website, <a href="/tools/webflow">Webflow</a> and <a href="/tools/squarespace">Squarespace</a> both have competent CMS features. Wix also supports blogging, though its editor can be sluggish on content-heavy pages. Framer's CMS is more limited and works best for simple content sections rather than full-blown blogs.
        </p>

        <h3>Budget-conscious multi-page sites</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="/tools/dorik">Dorik</a> is the value play. Starting at $4/mo with unlimited hosting and storage on all plans, it undercuts every other builder on price. The free plan allows up to 5 sites. The editor is less polished than Framer or Webflow, and the community is smaller, but for a straightforward multi-page website that does not need advanced CMS or e-commerce, Dorik gets the job done for less.
        </p>

        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/framer">Framer</a></strong> is the best all-around choice for most solo founders in 2026. It is fast, affordable, produces great-looking sites, and the AI generation saves real time. Start here unless you have a specific reason not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/webflow">Webflow</a></strong> is the right choice when you need CMS-driven content, complex layouts, or e-commerce with full design control. Invest the time to learn it and you will not outgrow it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/squarespace">Squarespace</a></strong> is best for portfolios, creative professionals, and small e-commerce stores where polished templates matter more than customization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/carrd">Carrd</a></strong> is the right call for single-page sites, landing pages, and link-in-bio pages where you want to spend minutes, not hours. At $19/year, the price is almost irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/dorik">Dorik</a></strong> is the budget pick for multi-page sites where you want to keep costs under $5/mo without compromising on basic functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="/tools/wix">Wix</a></strong> suits founders who want a huge template library, an app marketplace, and do not mind trading some performance for convenience.
