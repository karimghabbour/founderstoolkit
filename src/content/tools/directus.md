Directus is an open-source data platform that layers a real-time API and intuitive admin app on top of any SQL database. It supports REST and GraphQL out of the box, with granular role-based access control and built-in file storage. Ideal for solo founders who need a content backend with a visual dashboard, or who want to expose an existing database as an API without rewriting anything.
