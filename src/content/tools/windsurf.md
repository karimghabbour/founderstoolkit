Windsurf (formerly Codeium's editor) combines regular code completion with Cascade, an agent mode that can plan out multi-step tasks and execute them across your project. Tell it "add user authentication to this app" and it will create files, install packages, and wire things up.

The $15/mo price is its biggest selling point over Cursor. The product is solid, but the company had a turbulent 2025 — a $3B acquisition by OpenAI fell apart, and talent ended up split between Google and Cognition. If you are price-sensitive and want a capable AI IDE, it is worth trying. Just be aware that the company's future direction is less certain than competitors.
