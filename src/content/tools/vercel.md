description: "Frontend cloud platform for deploying web applications with zero configuration"
pros:
  - "Push to git and your site is live in under a minute — zero config"
  - "Free tier covers hobby projects and early-stage startups with generous limits"
  - "Preview deployments for every pull request so you catch issues before production"
cons:
  - "Costs escalate fast once you hit scale — bandwidth and serverless function charges add up"
  - "Some features (middleware, edge functions) lock you into the Vercel ecosystem"
  - "If Vercel goes down, your site goes down — no easy migration path for Next.js-specific features"

Vercel removes the gap between "code works on my machine" and "code works in production." Push to GitHub, and your site is deployed. Every pull request gets its own preview URL. You never think about servers, CDN config, or SSL certificates.

Built for Next.js (they make it), but works with Astro, SvelteKit, Nuxt, and plain static sites too. The free tier is genuinely generous — enough for most side projects and early startups. The risk is cost at scale: once you start hitting real traffic, the jump from free to $20/month to hundreds of dollars can be abrupt. Plan your exit strategy before you build too deep.
