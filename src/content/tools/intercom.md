Intercom is the 800-pound gorilla of customer messaging. It combines live chat, a shared inbox, ticketing, a help center, and an AI chatbot (Fin) into one platform. The Essential plan starts at $29 per seat per month, and the Advanced and Expert plans go to $85 and $132 per seat respectively. It is built for companies that want to handle support, onboarding, and product communication from a single dashboard.

For a solo founder, Intercom is a tough sell on price alone. The base plan is reasonable, but the moment you need proactive messages ($99/mo add-on), AI copilot for agents ($35/seat/mo extra), or WhatsApp support (usage-based), costs stack up quickly. If you are doing enough volume that AI resolution at $0.99 per conversation saves you real time, Intercom pays for itself. If you are getting 5 support emails a day, Crisp or Chatwoot will do the job at a fraction of the cost.
