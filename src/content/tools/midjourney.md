Midjourney generates images from text descriptions, and it does it better than most alternatives. Tell it "minimalist SaaS landing page hero illustration, purple gradient" and you get something you can actually use. The quality gap between Midjourney and free alternatives like DALL-E 3 is noticeable, especially for anything stylized or artistic.

The catch for solo founders: there is no free tier, and privacy costs extra. On the $10/month Basic plan, your prompts and images are visible to other users on the Midjourney website. If you are generating images for a product and do not want competitors seeing your creative direction, you need the $60/month Pro plan for stealth mode. For blog headers, social media graphics, and marketing materials where privacy does not matter, the Basic plan at roughly 5 cents per image is hard to beat.
