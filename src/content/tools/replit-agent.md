Replit Agent is an AI-powered development assistant that can build entire applications from a description. It plans the architecture, writes code, sets up databases, and deploys — all within the Replit cloud environment.

Ideal for solo founders who want a single platform for building, hosting, and iterating on their product. The cloud-first approach eliminates DevOps concerns.
