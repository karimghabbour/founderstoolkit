Replit Agent is the closest thing to "describe your app and get it built." You write a description, it plans the architecture, writes the code, sets up the database, and deploys — all without leaving the browser. For non-technical founders, this is genuinely powerful.

The tradeoff is control. You are building on Replit's platform, and moving your app somewhere else later is not straightforward. The new effort-based pricing means simple changes cost pennies, but complex features can add up. Best for validating ideas fast or building internal tools where long-term architecture matters less than getting something working today.
