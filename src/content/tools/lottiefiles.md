Lottie is a file format created by Airbnb that stores animations as small JSON files instead of heavy video or GIF files. A typical loading animation is 2-5KB as a Lottie file versus 200KB+ as a GIF. LottieFiles is the platform built around this format — it hosts a library of free and paid animations, provides a web editor, and offers player libraries for every major platform.

For solo founders, the value is in the library. Need a loading spinner? Search, preview, download. Need an animated checkmark for your success state? Same. The free tier gives you access to thousands of community animations. Pro at $4.50/month adds a larger upload quota, background removal for animations, and priority support. Unless you are building an animation-heavy product, the free tier covers what you need.
