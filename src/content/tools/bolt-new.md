Bolt.new by StackBlitz lets you prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web apps directly in the browser. It uses WebContainers to run Node.js natively without a server.

Great for solo founders who want to prototype and deploy quickly without setting up a development environment. The browser-based approach means you can build from any device.
