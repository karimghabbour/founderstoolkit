Bolt.new runs a full Node.js environment inside your browser using WebContainers. You describe what you want to build, it writes the code, and you see a live preview instantly. No installing Node, no terminal, no VS Code — just a browser tab.

This is genuinely useful for prototyping. You can go from "I need a landing page with a waitlist form" to a working app in minutes. But the limitations show up when you try to build something complex — the free tier token limits are tight, and the generated code sometimes needs cleanup before it is production-ready. Think of it as a rapid prototyping tool, not a replacement for a real development setup.
