Trae gives you free access to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in an AI IDE. That is a genuinely compelling offer — no other tool gives you premium AI models at zero cost. The editor is VS Code-based, and the Builder agent mode can handle multi-step tasks.

The elephant in the room is ByteDance. Security researchers found Trae collecting extensive user data and sending it to ByteDance servers, even when users opted out of telemetry. A Privacy Mode is in development but not yet released. If you are working on anything sensitive — client projects, proprietary code, anything with user data — this is a real concern. If you are building a personal side project and the privacy tradeoff does not bother you, the free AI access is hard to beat.
