Trae is a free AI-powered IDE from ByteDance that offers code completion, inline chat, and an agentic Builder mode for multi-step tasks. It supports multiple AI models and is based on VS Code.

An attractive option for solo founders who want a fully free AI IDE. The zero-cost approach is unmatched, though users should consider the data privacy implications.
