Tidio combines live chat with an AI chatbot (Lyro) in a package built for small online stores and service businesses. The free plan gives you 50 conversations per month and a 7-day trial of premium features. Paid plans start at $29/mo (Starter), jump to $59/mo (Growth), $749/mo (Plus), and $2,999/mo (Premium). It integrates with Shopify, WordPress, and Wix out of the box.

The visual chatbot builder is genuinely useful — you can create automated flows for common questions like shipping status or return policies without writing any code. The catch is the add-on pricing. That $29 or $59 base plan balloons once you add Lyro AI for automated answers ($39+/mo), extra Flows capacity ($29+/mo), and branding removal ($20/mo on Growth). A solo founder could easily hit $150/mo for what looked like a $59 plan. If you mostly need live chat without the AI extras, Crisp or tawk.to will cost less. If the AI chatbot is what you want, budget for the real price, not the sticker price.
