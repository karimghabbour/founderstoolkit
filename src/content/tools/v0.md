v0 is not trying to build your whole app. It does one thing: generate beautiful React components from descriptions or images. And it does that one thing really well. The output uses shadcn/ui and Tailwind, so the code is clean, accessible, and ready to paste into a Next.js project.

The workflow is: describe a component (or upload a screenshot), v0 generates it, you tweak the prompt until it looks right, then copy the code into your project. It is a UI generation tool, not an app builder. If you need a full stack, look at Lovable or Bolt.new. If you need a polished pricing page or dashboard layout in five minutes, v0 is unmatched.
