Figma is where most of the internet gets designed these days. It runs in the browser, which means no installing heavy software — just open a tab and start designing. The free tier gives you 3 projects with unlimited files, which is enough for most solo founders.

Even if you are not a designer, Figma is worth learning because the community files are incredible. Need a landing page design? There are hundreds of free templates. Need icons? Plugins handle it. The learning curve is real if you have never used design tools, but a weekend of tutorials gets you to a productive level for basic UI work.
