WordPress.com is the hosted, managed version of the open-source WordPress platform. It bundles hosting, security, and backups into a single subscription starting at $4/mo for a personal site. The Business plan at $25/mo unlocks custom plugins and advanced SEO, making it comparable to self-hosted WordPress without the server management overhead.
