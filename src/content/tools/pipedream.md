Pipedream is a workflow automation platform built for developers. Unlike no-code tools, it lets you write custom code in Node.js, Python, or Go alongside pre-built integrations, making it ideal for solo founders who are comfortable with code. The free plan includes 100 daily credits and 3 workflows, while paid plans start at $29/mo with higher credit limits and advanced features like GitHub sync.
