Chatwoot is the open-source alternative to Intercom that bootstrapped founders actually use. You can self-host the community edition for free on a $5-10/month VPS, or use their managed cloud starting at $19 per agent per month (Startups plan). Cloud tiers go up to $99/agent for Enterprise, and every paid plan includes Captain AI credits for automated replies — 300, 500, or 800 depending on your tier.

The self-hosted route is where Chatwoot shines for one-person operations. You get live chat, email, social channels, and a knowledge base without a monthly per-seat fee. The trade-off is real though: you are your own DevOps team, handling updates and uptime. If you are comfortable with Docker and basic server admin, this is the cheapest way to get a professional multi-channel support setup. If the idea of maintaining infrastructure makes you nervous, their cloud plans or Crisp's free tier are simpler paths.
