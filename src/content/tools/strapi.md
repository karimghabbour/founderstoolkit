Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that gives you full control over your content API. You can self-host it for free on your own server or use Strapi Cloud for a managed experience starting at $29/mo. Solo founders who are comfortable with Node.js can save money by self-hosting, while those who prefer a managed solution can use Strapi Cloud to avoid server maintenance.
