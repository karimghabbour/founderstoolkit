Plausible gives you clean website analytics in a script that weighs less than 1KB. No cookies, no consent banners, no complex setup. It is fully GDPR, CCPA, and PECR compliant out of the box because it does not collect personal data.

The dashboard shows visitors, page views, referrers, and top pages — the metrics you actually check. If you need user-level tracking, funnels, or A/B testing, this is not the tool. If you want to know "is my content working?" without the guilt of tracking your visitors, Plausible is the cleanest option. Self-hosting is free if you are comfortable managing a server; the hosted service starts at $9/month.
