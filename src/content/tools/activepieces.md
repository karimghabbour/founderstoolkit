Activepieces is an open-source workflow automation tool that can be self-hosted for free with no task limits, or used as a managed cloud service. The cloud free plan includes 1,000 task executions per month, while the Standard plan charges $5 per active flow per month with unlimited runs. For solo founders who want full data control without per-task pricing, the self-hosted Community Edition is a strong alternative to Zapier and Make.
