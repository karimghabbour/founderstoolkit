Cody's secret weapon is Sourcegraph's code graph. While most AI tools see only the files you have open, Cody can index and understand your entire repository. Ask it "where is the authentication logic?" and it actually knows, even if those files are not open.

At $9/month for Pro, it is the cheapest paid option in this category. The tradeoff is that the autocomplete and chat quality, while good, are not quite at the level of Cursor or Claude-based tools. Where Cody shines is on larger codebases where context matters most — if you have a complex project with many interconnected files, the code graph indexing genuinely helps.
