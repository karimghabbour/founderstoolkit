Codeium is the best free AI autocomplete you can add to your existing editor. It works in basically everything — VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, Emacs, you name it. The completions are good, and you are not hitting a paywall after a trial period.

The catch is that Codeium the extension is now the "free tier" of Windsurf the company. The more advanced features — agent mode, multi-file editing, deep project context — have moved to the Windsurf IDE. If you just want solid autocomplete in your current editor without paying anything, Codeium is the answer. If you want more, they want you to switch to Windsurf.
