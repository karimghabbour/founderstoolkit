Tally is the anti-Typeform. Instead of a complex visual builder, you type your form like you would write a document. Add a text field, a multiple choice question, a file upload — it works like Notion. And the free tier is genuinely generous: unlimited forms, unlimited responses, no branding.

For solo founders who need contact forms, surveys, or feedback forms, Tally is the fastest path from "I need a form" to "here is the link." The Pro plan at $29/month adds conditional logic and custom domains, but most founders will not need it.
