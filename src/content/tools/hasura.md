Hasura generates instant GraphQL and REST APIs from your PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, or other databases. It includes a built-in authorization engine with row-level permissions, event triggers, and the ability to federate multiple data sources into a single API. The free cloud tier is suitable for prototyping, though solo founders should note the jump to $99/mo for the Professional plan.
