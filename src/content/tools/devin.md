Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer by Cognition that can handle entire development tasks end-to-end. It can plan implementations, write code, run tests, debug issues, and submit pull requests.

Best suited for well-funded solo founders who need to scale their development capacity significantly. The high price point reflects its ability to work independently on substantial tasks.
