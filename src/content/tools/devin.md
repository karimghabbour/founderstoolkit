Devin is the most ambitious AI coding tool on this list. You assign it a task — "fix this bug," "add this feature," "set up CI/CD" — and it goes away, works on it, and comes back with a pull request. You do not sit and watch; it works asynchronously.

The $500/month price tag is steep for solo founders, and that is the honest reality. The people getting value from Devin are those with more tasks than time, who can keep it busy with well-defined work. If you have 3 bug fixes and 2 small features to ship this week and cannot hire a developer, Devin might pay for itself. If you are pre-revenue and watching every dollar, this is not where you start.
