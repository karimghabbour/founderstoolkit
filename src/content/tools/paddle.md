Paddle takes the scariest part of selling software internationally — tax compliance — and makes it someone else's problem. They act as the merchant of record, which means they are legally the seller. They collect the payment, handle VAT/sales tax in every country, and pay you a net amount. You never file a foreign tax return.

The price for this peace of mind is real: 5% + 50c per transaction versus Stripe's 2.9% + 30c. For many SaaS founders selling to customers in the EU, UK, and beyond, the math still works out — hiring an accountant or using a tax service would cost more. Paddle requires approval before you can start, so apply early.
