Crisp gives solo founders live chat, email support, and a knowledge base without paying Intercom prices. The free tier includes live chat and a shared inbox — enough to handle customer conversations professionally when you are the only person responding.

The interface is modern and does not feel like enterprise support software. On paid plans, you get chatbot automation and a knowledge base that can deflect common questions before they hit your inbox. The main gripe is the mobile app: notifications can be unreliable, which matters when you are the only person on support.
