WordPress.org is the self-hosted version of the world's most popular CMS. It provides complete flexibility through thousands of themes and plugins, making it suitable for blogs, portfolios, e-commerce stores, and more. Solo founders should budget for hosting, and be prepared to handle updates and security themselves or use managed WordPress hosting.
