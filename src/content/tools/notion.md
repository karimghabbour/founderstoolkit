Notion replaces your note app, your wiki, your project tracker, and your spreadsheet — or at least it tries to. The flexibility is both its strength and its trap. You can build a custom CRM, a content calendar, a knowledge base, and a task board all in one workspace. You can also spend three days tweaking your setup instead of doing actual work.

For solo founders, the free personal plan covers everything you need. The risk is not the price; it is the time sink. Start with a simple template (there are thousands), resist the urge to over-engineer, and Notion becomes genuinely useful. Over-engineer it, and it becomes a project of its own.
