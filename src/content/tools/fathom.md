Fathom gives you the analytics you actually look at — visitors, page views, top pages, referrers — and nothing else. No cookie consent banners (because there are no cookies), no complex custom reports, no spending an hour configuring dashboards. Open it, see your numbers, close it.

Founded by Jack Ellis and Paul Jarvis (of Company of One fame). At $14/month with no free tier, you are paying for simplicity and privacy. If you need funnels, cohort analysis, or event tracking, PostHog or even GA4 gives you more. If you just want to know "how many people visited and where did they come from," Fathom respects both your time and your visitors' privacy.
