Photopea is what you reach for when someone sends you a PSD file and you do not have Photoshop. It opens in a browser tab and handles Photoshop files with layers, masks, and effects intact. It also opens Sketch, XD, and Illustrator files, which makes it the universal translator of design file formats.

Built and maintained by a single developer, Ivan Kutskir, Photopea earns roughly $1M per year from ads alone. The $5/month premium removes ads and gives you higher-resolution export options. For solo founders who need occasional image editing but cannot justify Adobe's $23/month Photography plan, this covers 90% of what Photoshop does at a fraction of the cost — or free.
