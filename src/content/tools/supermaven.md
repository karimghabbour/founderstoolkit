Supermaven was the speed king of AI code completion — built by the creator of Tabnine, it focused on doing one thing (autocomplete) with extremely low latency and a massive context window. In November 2024, Cursor acquired Supermaven and is folding its technology into the Cursor editor.

The standalone VS Code and JetBrains plugins still work for now, but there are no new updates coming. If you were using Supermaven and liked it, the natural move is to Cursor, which now includes Supermaven's speed and context technology. There is no reason to start using Supermaven as a new user today.
