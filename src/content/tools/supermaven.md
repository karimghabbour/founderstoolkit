Supermaven delivers AI code completions with extremely low latency and a massive context window. Founded by the creator of Tabnine, it focuses on doing code completion exceptionally well rather than trying to be an all-in-one AI tool.

Great for solo founders who want the fastest possible code completions without the overhead of a full AI IDE. The large context window means better suggestions on bigger projects.
