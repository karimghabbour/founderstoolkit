Wix is one of the most popular website builders, offering a drag-and-drop editor with over 900 templates and an app market with hundreds of add-ons. The free plan includes Wix branding and a wixsite.com subdomain, while paid plans start at $17/mo and remove ads, add a custom domain, and unlock more storage. It is a solid choice for solo founders who want to launch quickly without touching code.
