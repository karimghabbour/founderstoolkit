Stripe lets you start accepting payments in an afternoon — no merchant account, no bank meetings, no weeks of paperwork. Copy a few lines of code (or use no-code Payment Links), and you have a working checkout. That is why almost every solo founder starts here.

The documentation is genuinely excellent — not just "good for a payments company" but one of the best developer docs on the internet. The dashboard shows you revenue, subscriptions, and customer data clearly. The catch: Stripe is a payment processor, not a merchant of record. That means you are still responsible for sales tax, VAT, and invoicing compliance. If selling internationally scares you, look at Paddle or LemonSqueezy instead.
