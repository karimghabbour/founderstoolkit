Linear is what happens when people who were frustrated with Jira build their own issue tracker. Every interaction is instant — no loading spinners, no waiting for pages. Keyboard shortcuts let you triage, assign, and move issues without touching the mouse.

For solo founders who also write code, the GitHub integration is the real selling point. Create a branch from a Linear issue, open a PR, and the issue moves automatically. It forces a clean workflow. The free tier covers individual use. If you are managing more than a sticky-note to-do list but less than a full Jira installation, Linear is the sweet spot.
