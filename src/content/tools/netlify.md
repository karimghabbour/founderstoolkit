Netlify pioneered the git-push deployment workflow and still does it well. Connect your repo, push code, get a live site. The built-in extras — form submissions, identity/auth, serverless functions — mean you can build a surprisingly complete app without bolting on extra services.

The free tier is solid for getting started, but watch the bandwidth and build minutes. A content-heavy site with images can blow through 100GB in a busy month. If you are building a static site or Jamstack app and want everything in one place, Netlify is a reliable choice. If unlimited bandwidth matters more, check Cloudflare Pages.
