LemonSqueezy is Paddle but friendlier for indie founders. Like Paddle, they act as the merchant of record — they collect the payment, handle all international taxes, and send you a net payout. Unlike Paddle, there is no approval process and no monthly minimum. You sign up and start selling.

The 5% fee hurts on every transaction, but do the math: if you sell $5,000/month, LemonSqueezy costs you $250 in fees. An accountant to handle international VAT filing costs more than that. If you sell exclusively in one country or only in the US, Stripe is cheaper. If you sell globally and do not want to think about tax compliance, LemonSqueezy trades money for sanity.
