Looka gets you from "I need a logo" to "here are 100 options" in about two minutes. You pick some styles you like, choose icons related to your business, select colors, and the AI generates a wall of logo options. Some look surprisingly professional. Others look like clip art. The quality depends on how picky you are about filtering.

The basic logo package at $20 gives you high-res PNG files. The $96/year Brand Kit adds SVG files, business card designs, social media templates, and a simple brand guidelines document. For a solo founder launching a side project who needs a logo this week, Looka beats spending $500+ on a freelance designer. For a serious brand you plan to grow, the AI output is a starting point at best — you will probably want a real designer eventually.
