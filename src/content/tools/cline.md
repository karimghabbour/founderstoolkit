Cline is an open-source autonomous coding agent that runs as a VS Code extension. It supports multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) and can autonomously create files, run terminal commands, and browse the web.

Ideal for solo founders who want maximum flexibility and control over their AI coding setup. You choose your model and only pay for API usage.
