Cline is a VS Code extension that turns your editor into an AI coding agent. Pick your AI model (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, local models through Ollama), give it a task, and it will plan, write code, run commands, and iterate. It asks for permission before each action, so you stay in control.

The big advantage over Cursor is flexibility and transparency. You see exactly what you are paying (API costs per request), you can switch models anytime, and there is no subscription. The big disadvantage is that you have to manage all of that yourself. If you want something that just works out of the box, Cursor is easier. If you want to pick your own model and only pay for what you use, Cline is the way.
