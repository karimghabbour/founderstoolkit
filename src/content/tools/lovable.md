Lovable (formerly GPT Engineer) is for founders who have an idea and want a working app, not a wireframe or a mockup. You describe what you want, and it generates a full-stack React app with a Supabase backend — auth, database, the works. You can then edit the code or keep iterating with prompts.

This is not a toy. People have shipped real MVPs with it. But know the limits: the generated code follows patterns the AI knows, which may not be the best patterns for your specific use case. If your app is a straightforward CRUD tool or marketplace, Lovable can get you 80% there. If you need complex real-time features or unusual architecture, you will hit walls.
