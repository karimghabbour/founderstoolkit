ConvertKit was built by Nathan Barry specifically for creators — bloggers, podcasters, course creators, and indie founders who need to grow an email list. It strips away the complexity of tools like Mailchimp and focuses on what actually matters: collecting subscribers, tagging them based on behavior, and sending the right emails at the right time.

The free tier gets you started, but the real value is in the automation and tagging on paid plans. The tradeoff is design flexibility — ConvertKit pushes you toward plain-text-style emails because they tend to convert better. If you need pixel-perfect HTML emails, look at MailerLite or Beehiiv instead.
