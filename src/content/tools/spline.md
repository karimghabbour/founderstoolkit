Spline brings 3D design into the browser the same way Figma brought 2D design into the browser. You can model objects, add materials, set up lighting, and animate — all without installing anything. The real selling point for web developers is the export: you get an embed code or React component that drops an interactive 3D scene directly into your site.

The free tier is generous enough for most use cases. Pro at $7/month adds private projects and removes the Spline watermark from exports. The main limitation is scope — this is for hero sections, interactive product showcases, and landing page eye candy. If you need serious 3D modeling, you still need Blender. But for the "I want a spinning 3D object on my homepage" use case, Spline gets it done in an afternoon instead of a week.
