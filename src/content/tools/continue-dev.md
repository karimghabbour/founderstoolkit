Continue is an open-source AI coding assistant that integrates with VS Code and JetBrains. It supports autocomplete, chat, and inline editing with any LLM provider including local models via Ollama.

A top pick for solo founders who want full control over their AI assistant and don't want to pay for a proprietary solution. The flexibility to swap models is a major advantage.
