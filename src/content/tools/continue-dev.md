  - "Less polished than Cursor or Copilot; occasional rough edges"
  - "Quality is only as good as the model you connect"

Continue is the "bring your own brain" approach to AI coding. It is a free, open-source extension for VS Code and JetBrains that connects to any LLM you want — cloud APIs like Claude and GPT-4, or local models through Ollama. You get autocomplete, chat, and inline editing without paying for a subscription.

The appeal is total freedom. Do not want to send code to the cloud? Run a local model. Want to switch between Claude for complex tasks and a fast local model for autocomplete? You can. The cost is setup time and some polish — it takes more effort to get running than Cursor, and the experience is not quite as seamless. But for developers who want control over their tools and their data, Continue is the best free option.
