description: "AI-powered snippet manager that saves, tags, and lets you reuse code across IDEs and browsers"
pros:
  - "Actually free for individuals — not time-limited"
  - "Works across IDEs, browsers, and collaboration tools so snippets follow you"
  - "On-device AI option means your code stays local"
cons:
  - "It is a snippet manager, not a coding assistant — different use case than Cursor or Copilot"
  - "Takes effort to build the habit of saving snippets instead of just re-Googling"
  - "Less useful if you do not frequently reuse code patterns across projects"
alternatives:
  - "github-copilot"

Pieces is not an AI coding assistant in the Cursor/Copilot sense. It is more like an AI-powered clipboard for code. Save a snippet from your browser, your editor, or a Slack message, and Pieces automatically adds descriptions, tags, and related context. When you need that snippet later, you search for it instead of digging through bookmarks.

The on-device AI is a nice touch — your code stays on your machine. Useful if you find yourself copy-pasting the same patterns across projects or constantly looking up that one regex you always forget. Less useful if your workflow does not involve much code reuse.
