Gumroad is where you sell something when you do not want to think about selling. Create a product, set a price, get a link. Share the link, people pay, you get money. The entire setup takes 5 minutes, which is why thousands of creators start here.

The 10% fee is painful — on a $50 ebook, you lose $5 per sale. At scale, that adds up to thousands of dollars a year you could keep by switching to Stripe or LemonSqueezy. But Gumroad's simplicity has value: you skip all the setup of payment processors, tax compliance, and checkout flows. Start on Gumroad to validate that people will pay for your thing, then migrate when the fees start hurting.
