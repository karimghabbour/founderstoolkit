Cloudflare Pages is the "set it and forget it" hosting option. Unlimited bandwidth on the free tier means you never worry about traffic spikes — if your blog post goes viral, you do not get a surprise bill. The site you are reading right now runs on Cloudflare Pages.

The tradeoff is developer experience. Vercel and Netlify have smoother workflows, faster builds, and more integrations. Cloudflare Pages is more bare-bones. But if your priority is reliable, fast, cheap hosting that does not punish you for success, it is hard to beat free-with-unlimited-bandwidth.
