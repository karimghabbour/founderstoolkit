Ahrefs tells you three things: what your competitors rank for, what backlinks they have, and what keywords you have a realistic chance of ranking for. That is the information you need to decide if organic search is worth pursuing for your business.

At $99/month, this is not a casual purchase. But if organic traffic is a key part of your growth strategy, Ahrefs pays for itself by keeping you from wasting months targeting keywords you will never rank for. Try their free webmaster tools first to see if the data is useful for your situation before committing to a paid plan.
