Contentful is a headless CMS designed for structured content that can be delivered to websites, apps, and other digital channels via API. It is widely used by larger teams and enterprises but offers a free Community tier suitable for solo projects. The jump from free to paid is steep at $300/mo, so solo founders should carefully evaluate whether they will outgrow the free tier.
