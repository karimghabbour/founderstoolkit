Tempo sits between a design tool and a code generator. You can import Figma designs, use AI prompts, or visually edit components with drag-and-drop — then export clean React and Tailwind code. It is the visual approach to AI-assisted coding.

If you think in terms of visual layouts rather than code, Tempo might click better than text-prompt tools like v0. The Figma import is particularly useful if you already have designs. The limitation is that it only outputs React, and the visual editor works better for UI than for business logic. Think of it as a UI building tool, not a full app builder.
