Tempo combines AI code generation with visual editing for building React applications. You can import Figma designs, use AI prompts, or visually edit components — then export clean React and Tailwind code.

A strong choice for solo founders who think visually and want a bridge between design and code. The Figma integration is particularly useful for design-minded builders.
