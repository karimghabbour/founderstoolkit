Copilot is the safe default. It works in almost every editor, the price is right, and if you already use GitHub for your repos, it plugs in without any extra setup. The inline suggestions are good for everyday coding — writing boilerplate, completing function signatures, filling in repetitive patterns.

Where it falls short compared to newer tools is deep project understanding. Cursor and Cline can reason about your entire codebase; Copilot's context window is more limited. The newer agent mode is improving this, but it is still playing catch-up. If you just want solid autocomplete at a low price, Copilot is hard to beat. If you want an AI that can refactor across 20 files, look elsewhere.
