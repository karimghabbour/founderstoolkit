description: "AI code editor (VS Code fork) that lets you talk to your codebase, autocomplete across files, and refactor with a prompt"
pros:
  - "Feels like VS Code — your extensions and shortcuts just work"
  - "Tab completions predict multi-line changes, not just single words"
  - "Can reference your entire codebase when answering questions"
cons:
  - "Free tier runs out fast — expect to hit the Pro paywall within a week of real use"
  - "Sometimes confidently suggests wrong code, especially for less popular libraries"
  - "Credit-based billing (since mid-2025) makes costs harder to predict"
alternatives:
  - "windsurf"

If you already use VS Code, Cursor is the shortest path to having AI actually understand your project. It is not just autocomplete — you can highlight code and ask "why is this breaking?" or tell it "add error handling to all API routes" and watch it edit multiple files.

The tab completions are the killer feature. They predict what you are about to type based on what you just did, and they are eerily good at continuing patterns. The free Hobby tier gives you a taste, but you will burn through the 50 premium requests quickly. Pro at $20/month is where most solo devs land. Since mid-2025 they switched to credit-based billing, so keep an eye on your usage if you are doing heavy agent work.
