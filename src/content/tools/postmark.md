Postmark has been laser-focused on one thing for over a decade: making sure transactional emails hit inboxes, not spam folders. Password resets, order confirmations, shipping notifications — the emails your users actually need to receive. They keep their deliverability high by refusing to send marketing email on the same infrastructure.

You pay more per email than alternatives, but for transactional messages where delivery matters (think: password resets, payment receipts), that premium buys real reliability. If your app sends emails that users rely on, Postmark is the safest bet.
