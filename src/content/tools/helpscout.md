Help Scout makes customer support feel like a personal email conversation, not a helpdesk ticket queue. When customers email you, they get a reply from a real email address, not a portal login. Behind the scenes, you get shared inboxes, collision detection, and saved replies to keep response times low.

The knowledge base feature (Docs) is surprisingly good — many solo founders use it as their entire documentation site. The downside is cost: at $20 per user per month with no free tier, it is a real expense for a one-person business. If you are handling support solo and want the feel of personal email with the organization of a help desk, Help Scout is the gold standard.
