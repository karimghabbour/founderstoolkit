Tabnine was one of the first AI code completion tools and its main selling point is privacy. It can run models entirely on your machine — your code never touches a server. For solo founders working on sensitive projects or under compliance requirements, that matters.

The honest truth is that Tabnine has fallen behind the newer tools in raw AI capability. Cursor, Copilot, and Claude-based tools produce better suggestions for most tasks. Tabnine also discontinued its free tier in April 2025, pushing individual developers to paid plans while focusing more on enterprise. If privacy is your top priority, Tabnine still has a niche. If you want the best AI suggestions, look elsewhere.
