Tabnine offers AI code completions with a strong focus on privacy and security. It can run models locally so your code never leaves your machine, making it suitable for projects with strict data requirements.

Good for solo founders who value code privacy or work on sensitive projects. The local execution option is unique among mainstream AI coding tools.
