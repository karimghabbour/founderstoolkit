Basecamp is project management from the people who wrote the book on bootstrapping (literally — REWORK, Shape Up). Built by Jason Fried and DHH at 37signals. Over 100k paying customers, profitable from day one, famously bootstrapped (except a small Bezos investment in 2006). They also make HEY email.
