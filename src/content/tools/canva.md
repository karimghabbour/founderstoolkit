Canva is the design tool for founders who do not have time to learn design. Need a social media graphic? Pick a template, swap the text, done. Need a pitch deck? Same process. It is not going to win design awards, but it gets you from "I need a visual" to "here it is" in 10 minutes.

The free tier covers most of what solo founders need. The $15/month Pro adds background removal, magic resize (turn an Instagram post into a Twitter header), and access to the full stock photo library — features that are genuinely time-saving if you create content regularly.
