Cal.com does what Calendly does, but it is free for individuals and open source. You get a booking page, calendar integrations, and the basics of scheduling without paying Calendly's rates.

If you are a solo founder who just needs a scheduling link, Cal.com saves you $10-20/month compared to Calendly. The tradeoff is polish — Calendly has had years more to smooth out the experience. Cal.com is good enough for most scheduling needs, and the option to self-host appeals to founders who want control over their data. If scheduling is mission-critical to your business and first impressions matter, Calendly or SavvyCal are more refined.
