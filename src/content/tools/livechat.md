LiveChat is a focused live chat tool, not a full helpdesk. It does one thing well: put a fast, good-looking chat widget on your site and let you talk to visitors in real time. The Starter plan is $20/agent/month billed annually ($24 monthly), and the Team plan jumps to $41/agent/month. It connects to over 200 tools and pulls messages from email, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and SMS into one inbox.

The widget itself is genuinely one of the best — fast to load, easy to customize, and does not slow your site down. The AI Copilot on paid plans suggests responses and summarizes long conversations, which helps when you are juggling support between other tasks. The downside is cost and fragmentation: there is no free tier, the Starter plan limits chat history to 60 days, and if you want automated chatbot responses you need to buy their separate ChatBot product ($52/mo). For a solo founder who wants live chat specifically and can justify the spend, it is polished. If you need a free option or want chatbot automation included, look at tawk.to or Tidio instead.
