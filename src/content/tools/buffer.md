Buffer does one thing and does it well: schedule social media posts. No CRM bolted on, no social listening dashboard, no enterprise features you will never use. Write your posts, pick your times, Buffer publishes them. Done.

For solo founders who need to maintain a social presence without spending hours on it, Buffer's simplicity is the point. The free tier is enough to manage a few accounts. The paid tier at $6 per channel is genuinely affordable. If you need advanced analytics, team collaboration, or social listening, you will outgrow Buffer — but most solo founders will not.
