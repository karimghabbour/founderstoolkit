Appwrite is an open-source backend platform that provides authentication, databases, file storage, cloud functions, and messaging as a unified service. It can be self-hosted for free or used via Appwrite Cloud starting at $25/mo per project. A good fit for solo founders who want a Firebase-like experience with the option to own their infrastructure.
