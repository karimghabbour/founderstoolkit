Aider is a terminal tool that pair-programs with you. You tell it what to change, it edits the files, and — here is the part that wins people over — it creates a clean git commit with a descriptive message. Every change is tracked, reviewable, and revertable. No other AI coding tool handles version control this naturally.

Built by Paul Gauthier, it consistently ranks at the top of SWE-bench coding benchmarks. The tradeoff is that it is terminal-only and requires you to bring your own API key. If you are already comfortable with git and the command line, aider fits into your workflow like a glove. If you want a visual editor experience, look at Cursor or Cline instead.
