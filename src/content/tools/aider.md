Aider is a command-line AI pair programmer that lets you collaboratively edit code with LLMs. It understands your git repo, suggests changes, and automatically creates well-described commits.

Great for solo founders comfortable with the terminal who want an open-source, flexible AI coding assistant. Top-ranked on SWE-bench coding benchmarks.
