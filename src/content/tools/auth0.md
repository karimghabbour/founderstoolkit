Auth0 is the auth provider you pick when your app needs enterprise features — SAML SSO, LDAP, MFA policies, organization management. It supports every login method that exists and has been battle-tested by companies from startups to Fortune 500s. It is now part of Okta.

For solo founders, Auth0 is often more than you need. If you just want social login and email/password, Clerk or Supabase Auth is simpler and faster to set up. Where Auth0 earns its complexity is when you need to sell to companies that require SSO, or when compliance demands specific auth flows. Start with something simpler and migrate to Auth0 when enterprise requirements show up.
