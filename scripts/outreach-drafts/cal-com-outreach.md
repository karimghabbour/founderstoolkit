# Outreach Draft: Cal.com (Peer Richelsen)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded by Peer Richelsen and Bailey Pumfleet
- Started because Peer needed scheduling for LeanHire.com (hiring marketplace)
- Existing tools (Calendly, SavvyCal) weren't built for infrastructure/customization needs
- Open source from day one — "infrastructure software needs to be open"
- Mission: connect 1 billion people by 2031
- Raised $30M+ but still very developer/community-driven
- Fastest-growing open source scheduling project on GitHub

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Growth (funded but still building community)
- **Personality:** Open source evangelist, infrastructure thinker, ambitious
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with Calendly (massive, established)
- **Values:** Openness, developer freedom, community-first

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Alignment (open source + indie founder audience)
- **Angle:** "Solo founders choosing scheduling tools find you through us"
- **Emotion to target:** Community, reaching the right audience

## Email Draft

**Subject:** cal.com in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Peer,

Cal.com is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a tools directory for solo founders. When they're picking a scheduling tool, you show up alongside Calendly and SavvyCal.

The open source angle is a big deal for our audience. These are technical founders who actually care about owning their infrastructure and not being locked into a SaaS they can't control. Your pitch lands perfectly with them.

If you'd want featured placement in the productivity category (top of the list), it's €39/mo, cancel whenever. The free listing stays either way.

Cheers
```
