## Email Draft

**Subject:** tally in a bootstrapped tools directory

**Body:**
```
Marie, Filip,

We're building founderstoolkit.org—a directory of tools specifically for solo founders. Tally's been on there since the start because it's exactly the kind of tool we want people to find: bootstrapped, user-focused, not another VC-backed behemoth.

Read your piece about being "small by design." Same philosophy here—we're a two-person operation, growing at our own pace.

Just wanted to say hi and let you know you're listed. If you ever want featured placement (top of productivity category, homepage feature), we offer that for €39/mo. No pressure either way—the listing stays regardless.

Keep building good things.
```
