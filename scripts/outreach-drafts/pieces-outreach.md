# Outreach Draft: Pieces (Tsavo Knott)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded in 2021 by Tsavo Knott (CEO) and Mack Myers in Cincinnati, Ohio — not SF, not NYC, building from the Midwest
- Tsavo was named Cincy Inno "5 under 25" — started this very young. Based in Over-the-Rhine neighborhood
- Raised $21.5M total ($8M seed from Drive Capital, $13.5M Series A also led by Drive Capital)
- Product started as a code snippet manager, evolved into an AI-powered developer productivity platform with "Live Context" across your entire OS. Air-gapped security has been a core philosophy since day one
- Unique angle: not just another copilot — focuses on the chaos of context switching and lost workflow

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Growth (Series A, expanding product scope)
- **Personality:** Young, ambitious, Midwest scrappy, product-obsessed
- **Pain indicators:** Competing against massive players (Copilot, Cursor) from Cincinnati, needs distribution outside tech bubble
- **Values:** Developer productivity, privacy/security, solving real workflow problems (not just autocomplete)

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity (underdog founder outside the SF bubble) + Liking (genuine product differentiation)
- **Angle:** Pieces solves a different problem than the typical AI coding tool — that's worth highlighting
- **Emotion to target:** Pride in being different from the copilot crowd

## Email Draft

**Subject:** pieces in the indie tools directory

**Body:**
```
Tsavo,

Added Pieces to founderstoolkit.org — we're a directory specifically for tools that solo founders use to build their businesses.

What caught my attention is that Pieces isn't trying to be another autocomplete copilot. The focus on context switching and workflow chaos is a genuinely different angle, and the air-gapped security thing matters a lot to the indie founders in our audience who are careful about where their code goes.

You're listed free in the AI & Coding category. We do featured listings for €39/mo if you ever want top placement — cancel whenever. No strings.

Cheers
```
