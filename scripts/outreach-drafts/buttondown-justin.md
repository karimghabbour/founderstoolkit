- Competes with Mailchimp (20,000+ employees)

**Body:**

Justin,

Added Buttondown to founderstoolkit.org a while back. We're building a directory specifically for solo founders to find tools that aren't the default enterprise options—seemed like a natural fit given your whole thing.

Read your interview about patience being a virtue for growth. Resonated. We're taking the same approach here.

Anyway, just wanted to let you know you're listed. If you ever want to show up first in the email category, we do featured listings (€39/mo, cancel whenever). No pressure—the regular listing stays regardless.

Cheers
```
