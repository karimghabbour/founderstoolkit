# Outreach Draft: SavvyCal (Derrick Reimer)

## Research Summary
- Founded 2020 by Derrick Reimer (previously built Drip, sold to Leadpages; also built StaticKit, Codetree)
- "Hybrid bootstrapper" — some TinySeed + angel money, but no VC
- Built SavvyCal because he felt anxious using existing scheduling tools (the UX bothered him)
- Grew to $1M+ ARR with smart positioning and clean UX
- Previously tried building a Slack competitor (Level) — too hard to displace incumbents
- Learned from that failure: pick a market where you can actually win
- Active on the Tuple podcast, Art of Product podcast

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Established indie SaaS (profitable, growing)
- **Personality:** Craftsman, product-obsessed, learns from failure
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with Calendly (dominant), Cal.com (open source + free)
- **Values:** Product quality, bootstrapper community, sustainable business

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity + Liking (indie founder tribe, shared values)
- **Angle:** "You're listed alongside Calendly — let's make sure founders see you first"
- **Emotion to target:** Competitive positioning, pride in product craft

## Email Draft

**Subject:** savvycal vs calendly — on founderstoolkit.org

**Body:**
```
Derrick,

SavvyCal is listed on founderstoolkit.org alongside Calendly and Cal.com. When solo founders compare scheduling tools, you're in the mix.

Listened to you on Art of Product talking about the Slack competitor that didn't work out, and how that shaped your approach to SavvyCal. Picking fights you can win — I think about that a lot building this directory.

If you'd want to show up first in the productivity category (featured placement), it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. Might be worth it given who's browsing — indie founders choosing their stack. The free listing stays regardless.

Cheers
```
