# Outreach Draft: Tabnine (Dror Weiss)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded in 2013 as Codota by Dror Weiss (CEO) and Eran Yahav (CTO, professor at Technion) in Tel Aviv — over a decade of AI coding before it was trendy
- Acquired the original Tabnine product (built by Jacob Jackson, now at Cursor) in 2019, rebranded in 2021
- Raised $102M total. 1M+ developers, 10M+ IDE installs. Used by LG, Samsung, Accenture
- Privacy and security are core differentiators — they explicitly took an ethical stance on not training on customers' code. Enterprise-first approach in a market full of "move fast and break things" startups
- Still the underdog against GitHub Copilot despite being one of the OGs

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Mature growth (10+ years, pivoting to maintain relevance in fast-moving market)
- **Personality:** Academic roots, principled, long-term thinker
- **Pain indicators:** Being the "original" AI coding tool but overshadowed by newer, flashier competitors
- **Values:** Privacy, ethics, enterprise trust, academic rigor

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Authority (decade of experience) + Unity (the underdog against Big Tech)
- **Angle:** Tabnine was doing AI coding before the hype — that longevity matters to careful founders
- **Emotion to target:** Respect for being the pioneer that's still standing

**Subject:** tabnine in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Dror,

Listed Tabnine on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for tools that solo founders and small teams rely on.

You've been doing AI-assisted coding since 2013, which in this market basically makes you ancient in the best possible way. Our audience tends to be skeptical of the new flashy thing every week. A tool that's been around for a decade and still takes code privacy seriously stands out.

Tabnine is listed free in the AI & Coding category. If you'd ever want top placement, we offer featured listings at €39/mo (cancel anytime). No pressure — just wanted you to know you're in there.

Cheers
```
