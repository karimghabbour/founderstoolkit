# Outreach Draft: Cline (Saoud Rizwan)

## Research Summary
- Founded by Saoud Rizwan, who built the original prototype (then called "Claude Dev") in his mom's garage in Terre Haute for an Anthropic hackathon in July 2024 — didn't even win
- Open-sourced from day one, went viral organically. Now 5M+ installs, 48k GitHub stars, grew from 1 person to 35+ (many hired from open-source contributors)
- Raised $32M (Series A + Seed) from Emergence Capital and Pace Capital. Pioneered the "Plan/Act" mode concept — AI pauses to think before acting
- Philosophy: coding with AI should be powerful, transparent, and fully under the developer's control

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Rapid growth (viral open-source project turned funded startup)
- **Personality:** Builder, open-source evangelist, values transparency and developer autonomy
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with Cursor ($29B), GitHub Copilot — needs visibility outside the "already-know-about-it" crowd
- **Values:** Open source, community, transparency, developer control

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity (indie builder tribe) + Social Proof (directory presence among peers)
- **Angle:** Respect the garage-to-millions origin, founder-to-founder
- **Emotion to target:** Pride in the open-source community approach

## Contact

## Email Draft

**Subject:** cline in the solo founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Saoud,

We listed Cline on founderstoolkit.org — it's a directory specifically for tools that solo founders and small teams actually use, not the default big-company options.

The garage-in-Terre-Haute origin story is one of my favorites in this whole AI coding wave. Building a hackathon project that didn't win into something with 5 million installs is the kind of thing our audience relates to.

Cline's already getting traffic from our AI & Coding category. If you'd ever want top placement there, we do featured listings for €39/mo (cancel anytime). Either way, the free listing stays up.

Cheers
```
