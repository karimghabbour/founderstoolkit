## Email Draft

**Subject:** help scout in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Nick,

Help Scout's been listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders looking for tools that aren't the default enterprise option. The kind of founders who'd pick Help Scout over Zendesk.

Your piece about being inspired by Mailchimp and 37signals resonated. We're building this directory with the same philosophy — useful, human, no bloat.

If you'd want featured placement in the support category (top of the list when founders compare options), it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. The free listing stays regardless.

Cheers
```
