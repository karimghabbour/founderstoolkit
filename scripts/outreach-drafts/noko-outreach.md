# Outreach Draft: Noko (Amy Hoy)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded by Amy Hoy and Thomas Fuchs (originally called "Freckle")
- Started 2008 while both were consulting — built it because existing time trackers were miserable
- Amy is famously risk-averse: didn't quit consulting, built on the side
- Thomas: Prototype.js creator, Rails core alumni, worked with world-famous companies
- $400K+/year revenue, small team, fully bootstrapped
- Amy also runs Stacking the Bricks — teaches people to build products
- "The bestest, most cheerful time tracking app" — their actual manifesto
- Deliberately NOT trying to be a unicorn

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Established lifestyle business (profitable, intentionally small)
- **Personality:** Opinionated, principled, teacher, anti-VC
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with Toggl, Harvest (larger, funded)
- **Values:** Independence, risk-aversion, joy in craft, teaching

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity (anti-VC, intentionally small, bootstrapped tribe)

**Body:**

Amy,

Noko is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders. Time tracking is one of those categories where people default to Toggl or Harvest without knowing better options exist. We're trying to fix that.

I've read Stacking the Bricks. The whole "don't quit your job, build on the side, be risk-averse" approach is basically our business plan. We're a small operation, growing slowly, no outside money.

If you'd ever want featured placement in the productivity category, it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. No pressure — the free listing stays regardless.

Thanks for teaching people to build real businesses.
```
