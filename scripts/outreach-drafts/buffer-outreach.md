**Subject:** buffer in the indie founder directory

**Body:**
```
Joel,

Buffer's listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory of tools for solo founders. The kind of people who do their own social media (and often use Buffer to do it).

Always respected the transparency thing — public salaries, open dashboard. Most companies talk about values, you actually published yours in a spreadsheet. That's a different breed.

If you'd ever want featured placement in the marketing category, we offer that for €39/mo, cancel anytime. The regular listing stays no matter what.

Keep building differently.
