# Outreach Draft: Aider (Paul Gauthier)

## Research Summary
- Built by Paul Gauthier, a veteran engineer (ex-CTO at Groupon, VP Engineering at Geomagical Labs/IKEA, PhD research at UC Berkeley that led to Inktomi)
- Aider is open-source, terminal-based AI pair programming — no VC, no hype cycle, just a well-built tool. 40k+ GitHub stars
- Paul does the bulk of the development himself. The project is essentially a one-person show with community contributions
- Started in 2023, one of the earliest AI coding tools that actually worked well with git integration

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Established indie project, organic growth
- **Personality:** Deeply technical, independent, experienced (decades of engineering leadership)
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with VC-backed tools (Cursor, Copilot) while staying independent
- **Values:** Craft, independence, simplicity, open source, terminal-first workflows

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Liking (respect for the indie approach) + Unity (solo builder kinship)
- **Angle:** One builder to another — aider is the kind of tool our audience builds with
- **Emotion to target:** Respect for staying independent while the space goes crazy with VC money

**Subject:** aider listed on founderstoolkit.org

**Body:**
```
Paul,

Added Aider to founderstoolkit.org a while back. We're a directory of tools for solo founders — the kind of people who'd rather use a terminal-based pair programmer than click around an IDE they don't control.

Honestly, in a space where every other tool has raised hundreds of millions, the fact that Aider is one person doing serious engineering and shipping something with 40k stars is exactly why it belongs in this directory.

You're listed free in our AI & Coding category. We also do featured listings (€39/mo, cancel whenever) if you ever want the top spot. No pressure — just wanted you to know you're there.

Cheers
```
