## Email Draft

**Subject:** pocketbase in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Gani,

PocketBase is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders picking their tech stack. "Backend in a single file" is exactly the kind of thing our audience gets excited about. No infrastructure overhead, just ship.

What you've built solo is genuinely impressive. The indie dev community loves it, and we wanted to make sure founders who aren't on GitHub discover it too.

We do featured listings (top of the backend category, homepage visibility) for €39/mo if that ever interests you. Totally understand if not — the free listing stays regardless, and we're happy to keep promoting PocketBase either way.

Cheers
```
