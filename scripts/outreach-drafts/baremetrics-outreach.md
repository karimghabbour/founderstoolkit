Hey team,

Baremetrics is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory of tools for solo founders and bootstrapped SaaS businesses. Basically the exact people who sign up for Baremetrics.

I've always appreciated the Founder Chats series and the open startup ethos Josh built into the brand. That spirit is why Baremetrics was one of the first analytics tools we added.

If you'd want featured placement (top of the analytics category, homepage visibility), it's €39/mo, cancel whenever. No contracts. The free listing stays either way.

Cheers
```
