## Email Draft

**Subject:** tuple in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Ben,

Tuple's listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders picking their tools. Pair programming tools are a niche category, which is exactly why we include them. Generic "top 10 SaaS" lists never would.

Your story about selling $8K before the product existed is one of my favorite bootstrapping examples. Building the audience first, product second. That's the playbook.

If you'd want featured placement (top of productivity, homepage visibility), it's €39/mo, cancel whenever. The free listing stays either way.

Cheers
```
