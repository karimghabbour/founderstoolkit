## Email Draft

**Subject:** userlist in the tools directory

**Body:**
```
Jane,

Userlist is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory of tools for solo founders and small SaaS teams. Basically your exact customer profile.

Heard your Indie Hackers episode about taking three years to hit $5K MRR. That kind of patience is rare and I respect it. We're on a similar timeline with this directory — slow, deliberate, no shortcuts.

If you'd ever want featured placement in the email category (top of the list when founders are comparing options), it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. The regular listing stays no matter what.

Keep at it — rooting for you.
```
