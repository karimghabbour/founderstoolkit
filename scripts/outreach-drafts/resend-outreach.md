# Outreach Draft: Resend (Zeno Rocha)

## Research Summary
- Founded by Zeno Rocha, Brazilian developer, previously VP of Developer Experience at WorkOS
- Used $300K from a bootstrapped project to consider self-funding, then went through YC
- Backed by a16z and YC, but still thinks like a bootstrapper
- 15,000 users within 8 months of launch
- Built because existing email APIs (SendGrid, Mailgun) had terrible DX
- Strong open source presence (React Email)
- Quote: "Resend is built by indie hackers"

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Early growth (funded but still scrappy)
- **Personality:** Developer-first, open source advocate, builder culture
- **Pain indicators:** Competing with established email APIs (SendGrid/Twilio)
- **Values:** Developer experience, open source, speed

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity (indie hacker identity, builder tribe)
- **Angle:** "We use Resend ourselves" (founderstoolkit.org uses Resend for outreach)
- **Emotion to target:** Community, mutual support

## Email Draft

**Subject:** we actually use resend

**Body:**
```
Zeno,

We use Resend to send outreach emails for founderstoolkit.org — a tools directory for solo founders. So when I say Resend is listed on the site, it's because we genuinely picked it ourselves.

Read your tweet about Resend being "built by indie hackers." Same energy here. We're a small operation curating tools for people who build things alone.

You're in the email category already. If you'd want featured placement (top of the list, homepage visibility), it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. No pressure — the listing stays regardless.

Thanks for building a good email API.
```
