# Outreach Draft: Tempo (Kevin Michael & Peter Gokhshteyn)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded by Kevin Michael (CEO) and Peter Gokhshteyn, both University of Waterloo Systems Design Engineering grads. Forbes 30 Under 30 in Consumer Technology
- Previously helped build Perpetua (acquired for ~$150M). Started Tempo because every low-code tool they tried during Perpetua was terrible for working with existing codebases
- Raised $5M seed from YC, Golden Ventures, Box Group, Webflow Ventures, iNovia, General Catalyst. Angels include Lenny Rachitsky
- Product: visual editor for React that generates 60-80% of front-end code, so engineers focus on business logic instead of CSS

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Early (seed stage, post-YC, building momentum)
- **Personality:** Design-minded engineers, experienced founders (not first-time)
- **Pain indicators:** New product needs awareness, competing in a crowded AI builder space
- **Values:** Design quality, engineering productivity, bridging the design-code gap

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Liking (shared frustration with bad low-code tools) + Authority (directory credibility)
- **Angle:** Solo founders are exactly who needs a faster way to ship front-ends
- **Emotion to target:** Validation that the design-engineering bridge matters

## Email Draft

**Subject:** tempo in the founder tools directory

**Body:**
```
Kevin,

Listed Tempo on founderstoolkit.org — a directory where solo founders find tools to build faster. Your tool is in the AI & Coding category.

The backstory resonated with me: building Perpetua and being frustrated that every low-code tool fell apart the moment you needed it to work with a real codebase. That's the exact pain point our audience hits constantly.

If you'd want top placement in the category, we do featured listings (€39/mo, cancel anytime). Either way, the regular listing is there for good.

Cheers
```
