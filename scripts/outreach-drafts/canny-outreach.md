## Email Draft

**Subject:** canny in the bootstrapped tools directory

**Body:**
```
Sarah,

Canny's listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders finding tools to run their businesses. Feedback tools are one of our most browsed categories, since every founder obsesses over what users actually want.

Read your piece about leaving Facebook and choosing not to raise — "didn't like the idea of not owning what we're making." That sentence stuck with me. Same reason we bootstrapped this directory.

If you'd want featured placement in the feedback category (top of the list), it's €39/mo, cancel whenever. The free listing stays regardless.

Keep building what's yours.
```
