# Outreach Draft: Continue (Ty Dunn & Nate Sesti)

## Research Summary
- Co-founded June 2023 by Ty Dunn (CEO) and Nate Sesti (CTO). Ty was helping Rasa's research team use GPT-3/Codex in 2021; Nate was writing code at NASA but couldn't use LLMs due to privacy concerns
- YC alum, raised ~$5M total (YC + Heavybit-led seed). 23k+ GitHub stars, 11k Discord members
- Open-source philosophy is central: "give a little, get a little" — they believe developers should own their AI coding setup, not be locked into one vendor
- Continue 1.0 launched with a Hub for sharing custom AI coding assistants — modular, bring-your-own-model approach

## Psychological Profile
- **Stage:** Early growth (post-1.0 launch, small team, building community)
- **Personality:** Thoughtful, principled, developer-first
- **Pain indicators:** Small team competing against Cursor, Copilot, Cline — needs distribution
- **Values:** Open source, developer autonomy, privacy, modularity

## Selected Approach
- **Principle:** Unity (indie builder values) + Reciprocity (free listing already live)
- **Angle:** The "bring your own model" philosophy resonates with solo founders who want control
- **Emotion to target:** Validation that the open-source, modular approach matters

## Email Draft

**Subject:** continue listed in the indie tools directory

**Body:**
```
Ty,

We added Continue to founderstoolkit.org — a directory for tools that solo founders and small teams use to build their businesses.

The "bring your own model" approach is a real differentiator for our audience. These are people who don't want to be locked into one AI vendor's ecosystem, and Continue is one of the few tools that actually respects that.

You're listed free in the AI & Coding category. If you ever want top placement, we do featured listings for €39/mo (cancel whenever). No pressure at all — the free listing isn't going anywhere.

Cheers
```
