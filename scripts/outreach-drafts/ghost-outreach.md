## Email Draft

**Subject:** ghost in the indie tools directory

**Body:**
```
John,

Ghost is listed on founderstoolkit.org — a directory for solo founders choosing their tools. In the content category, you sit alongside WordPress and Substack. We think founders should know there's a nonprofit option that isn't trying to monetize their audience.

Your whole setup — nonprofit, no investors, funded entirely by the people who use it — is the kind of thing our audience specifically looks for. They're skeptical of platforms with misaligned incentives.

If you'd ever want featured placement (top of the content category), it's €39/mo, cancel anytime. The free listing stays either way.

Thanks for keeping publishing independent.
