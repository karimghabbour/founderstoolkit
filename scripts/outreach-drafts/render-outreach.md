**Subject:** render on founderstoolkit.org

**Body:**
```
Anurag,

Quick note — Render's been listed on founderstoolkit.org for a while. We're a tools directory specifically for solo founders and small teams, which seems like exactly the audience you built Render for.

Saw you started this after watching 20% of Stripe's engineering team wrangle AWS. That frustration is very real for the founders browsing our site — they want to ship, not configure infrastructure.

You're already in the hosting category. If you'd ever want top placement there (first thing visitors see), we do featured listings for €39/mo. Cancel whenever, no commitment. The free listing stays either way.

Cheers
```
