# Email Forwarding Setup

Replies to hello@founderstoolkit.org need to go somewhere you can read them.

## Cloudflare Email Routing (Free)

1. Go to Cloudflare → founderstoolkit.org → Email → Email Routing
2. Click "Get Started" or "Add Address"
3. Create a route:
   - Custom address: `hello`
   - Forward to: YOUR_PERSONAL_EMAIL
4. Verify your personal email (Cloudflare sends confirmation)
5. Done - all replies now forward to your inbox

Takes 2 minutes.
